# AdvancedNEPSE

Welcome to the AdvancedNEPSE project! This repository is dedicated to conducting thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and developing predictive models for the Nepalese stock market data. Our goal is to leverage advanced data science techniques to forecast market trends and assist in decision-making.

## Project Overview

The AdvancedNEPSE project aims to provide deep insights into the stock market behavior using historical data from NEPSE. We are employing various data science methodologies to understand patterns, trends, and potentially predictive attributes.

### Current Progress
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Ongoing analysis to understand the underlying patterns and trends in the data. (Note: Monthly data visualization is pending.)
- **Model Development**:
  - **LSTM Model**: A preliminary Long Short-Term Memory model has been implemented to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
  - Further enhancements are planned, including integration of more complex features and improving model accuracy.

### Upcoming Features
- **Candlestick Interface**: Implementing a candlestick interface using Streamlit and Django to visualize stock movements more interactively.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Incorporation of monthly and weekday data to refine the forecasting model.
- **Decision-Making Model**: Transitioning the project towards a decision-making model to provide actionable insights for investors and traders.

### Challenges
- Busy schedules have delayed some aspects of the project, such as monthly data visualization.
- Continuously looking to implement new ideas and improve the existing model.

## How to Contribute

This project thrives on your contributions and ideas:
1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your forked repository to your machine.
3. **Create** your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
4. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some YourFeature'`).
5. **Push** to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
6. Submit a **Pull Request** so we can review your changes and merge them into the main project.

## Future Plans

- Integrate advanced analytical tools and frameworks to enhance our analytical capabilities.
